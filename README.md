# About Win-Keystore
Win-Keystore provides a simple and secure way to store sensitive or private data on Windows, ensuring that it remains protected from unauthorized access.

Built on top of Windows' Data Protection API (DPAPI) and SQLite, Win-Keystore leverages the powerful encryption capabilities of DPAPI to securely encrypt user data. The encrypted data is then stored in an SQLite database, ensuring that sensitive information is both securely protected and easily accessible.

With Win-Keystore, developers can easily integrate secure data storage into their Windows applications without having to worry about complex encryption mechanisms.
